# Poulet au Vinaigre

Cobbled together from Bittman & Vongerichten.

* 1 chicken, cut into serving pieces (or 2.5 to 3 lbs. chicken parts)

* 2 tablespoons olive oil

* 2 tablespoons butter (or more olive oil)

* 1‚ÅÑ4 cup minced shallot (or scallion)

* A bunch of unpeeled garlic cloves

* 6 to 8 sprigs thyme

* 1 cup sherry vinegar

* Salt and pepper

* Flour

Preheat oven to 450. Set large skillet (with steep sides to minimize
spattering) over high heat for about 2 minutes. Add 2 T. oil and 1 T. butter.
When the butter melts, place chicken in skillet, skin side down, along with the
garlic and thyme.

Cook undisturbed for about 5 minute or until nicely browned. Turn and cook for
3 minutes on the other side. Season with salt and pepper if desired.

Place chicken in oven. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until just about done
(juices run clear and there will be the barest trace of pink near bone).
Transfer chicken to an ovenproof platter. Place in oven. Turn off oven and
leave door slightly ajar.

Pour off most of the cooking juices from skillet. Place over med-high heat. Add
shallots. Cook, stirring, until tender about 2 minutes. Add vinegar. Raise heat
to high. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes until the powerful smell has subsided
somewhat. Add 1/2 cup water. Cook another 2 minutes, stirring until it's
slightly reduced and somewhat thickened. Return chicken and any accumulated
juices to skillet. Turn chicken in sauce. Add some flour to the sauce to
thicken, and set aside. Serve immediately.
