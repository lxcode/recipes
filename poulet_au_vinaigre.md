# Poulet au Vinaigre

* 2 tablespoons olive oil (or butter)

* 1 chicken, cut into serving pieces (or 2.5 to 3 lbs. chicken parts)

* 1‚ÅÑ4 cup minced scallion (or shallot)

* 1 cup high-quality red wine vinegar


Preheat oven to 450. Set large skillet (with steep sides to minimize
spattering) over med-high heat. Add 2 T. oil and wait a minute. When it is good
and hot, place chicken in skillet, skin side down. 

Cook undisturbed for about 5 minute or until nicely browned. (For breasts, it
was only 4 minutes.) Turn and cook for 3 minutes on the other side. Season with
salt and pepper if desired.

Place chicken in oven. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes or until just about done
(juices run clear and there will be the barest trace of pink near bone).
Transfer chicken to an ovenproof platter. Place in oven. Turn off oven and
leave door slightly ajar.

Pour off most of the cooking juices from skillet. Place over med-high heat. Add
scallions. Cook, stirring, until tender about 2 minutes. Add vinegar. Raise
heat to high. Cook for 1 or 2 minutes until the powerful smell has subsided
somewhat. Add 1/2 cup water. Cook another 2 minutes, stirring until it's
slightly reduced and somewhat thickened. Return chicken and any accumulated
juices to skillet. Turn chicken in sauce. Serve immediately.
