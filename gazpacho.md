# Mexican Gazpacho

There are many variations of gazpacho --- this style is variously referred to as
"rustic" or "chunky" gazpacho, as opposed to the pureed Spanish style which
generally also contains bread, and is most commonly seen in Mexico. Note that
"tomato juice" does not mean "V-8". All herb measurements are for fresh herbs.

Dishes that pair well are bread, shrimp, tortillas/tortilla chips or other
Mexican dishes. You may wish to toss some bread into it, to make it more filling,
which it isn't at all by default. Oh, and margaritas.

## Ingredients

* 2 qts Tomato juice
* 3 diced cucumbers (peeled)
* 5 diced tomatoes (not peeled)

## Directions

## Variations
