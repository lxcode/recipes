# Potato, onion and caper salad

A simple tasty potato salad from the Cyclades.

* 2.5 lbs potatoes, peeled and cut into large chunks
* 1 largeish red onion, peeled and thinly sliced
* 1/3c capers
* 3 T finely chopped fresh flat-leaf parsley
* 3 T olive oil
* 1.5 T red wine vinegar
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper

Boil the potatoes and drain in a colander. Transfer to a large bowl and combine
with the other ingredients, seasoning with salt and pepper. Serve while potatoes
are still warm. Though it's just as tasty cold.
