# Halibut Piccata

## Ingredients

* 4 fresh halibut fillets
* 20 non-pareil capers
* juice of 2 lemons
* hella butter
* good handful of fresh dill, chopped
* flour
* black pepper
* 1 c. most any white wine
* a number of peeled garlic cloves

## The sauce

Reduce the wine until it reaches about 1/4 cup.  Whip in about 2 sticks of
butter(not pre-melted), add the dill, lemon, and capers, along with a dash of
the capers' juice as well.  Bring it to a boil and then let it back down.

## The fish

Pat dry, cover lightly with flour, and grind black pepper over.  Melt some
butter in the pan(or use olive oil), cook the things till they're done.  It's a
good idea to throw in some minced garlic(4 cloves or so) into the pan, saute it
for a bit, and then throw part of it into the sauce.

I suggest asparagus as a side - the piccata sauce goes great with it, kind of like Hollandaise.
