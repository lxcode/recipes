# Krumkake (Vegan)

* 3 tablespoons flax seeds
* 1⁄2 cup water
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1 cup sugar
* 1⁄2 cup Crisco shortening, melted
* 1⁄2 cup soymilk
* 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
* 2 cups flour
* canola oil cooking spray

1. In a blender, grind flax seed into meal.
2. Add the 1/2 cup plus 1 Tablespoon water and blend until incorporated, then pour into a mixing bowl.
3. Add the sugar, Crisco, soy milk (vanilla flavored works fine,) and vanilla extract and mix well with a wooden spoon. 1/2 teaspoon cardamom or cinnamon, or any other spice may be added to the mix prior to the flour if you like.
4. Add 1 1/2 cups flour and stir until incorporated. Add additional flour only to make a very soft dough, up to the remaining 1/2 cup, but not necessarily the full amount, The mixture should be thicker than a batter, but not a stiff dough. Less flour makes a lighter, crisper
   cookie. More flour makes a thicker cookie.
5. Allow the dough to rest while heating the cookie iron.
6. Spray krumkake iron with oil prior to placing dough for each cookie, or as needed to prevent sticking.
7. When cookie iron is ready, spoon approximately one tablespoon of batter to make each five inch cookie. The cookie is done when steam stops escaping from the sides of the cookie iron and the cookies are very lightly browned.
8. Remove cookies from iron by rolling over a wooden krumkake pin, wooden spoon handle, or with a non-metal spatula to make flat cookies.
9. Place on cookie racks to cool before stacking.
10. Repeat to use remaining dough.
11. Cooking time is approximate and depends on how quickly or slowly the cook can roll a krumkake!
12. Cookies are best stored in tins to retain their crispness.
13. Fill with vegan frosting, fruit, or whatever pleases you. Dust with powdered sugar if you like. They are fine without, as well.
