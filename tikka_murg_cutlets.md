# Tikka Murg cutlets

* 2-2.5 lb boneless chicken breast
* 2-3 cups of soft white bread crumbs (wheat germ also works well)
* 1 cup finely chopped onions
* .5 cup coarsely chopped fresh tomatoes (or half a can of diced)
* .25 cup finely chopped fresh coriander (if you can't find it, 1tsp of ground coriander)
* 1 tbsp finely chopped fresh ginger root (very finely - throw this in the food processor with the garlic, give it a few bursts)
* .5 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
* 1 teaspoon garam masala
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1/8 teaspoon ground hot red pepper
* 1 tablespoon salt
* 1 whole egg
* 1/4 cup ghee (melted butter, unless you want to get really ethnic - or you could use olive oil, for that matter)

Grind the chicken in the food processor, but do the garlic, onions and ginger
first. Mix together chicken, 1 cup bread crumbs, onions, tomatoes, coriander,
ginger, garlic, garam masala, cumin, red pepper salt and egg. Mix it real well.
Divide into eight equal portions and smush into patties; heat a skillet with the
ghee until hot enough to splatter a drop of water, then turn heat to sorta low;
dip the patties in bread crumbs and put them into the pan, fry 7 or eight minutes
per side or until they are done. Then eat them.
