# Linguine with saffron oil

Super simple but fancy. From Vongerichten and Bittman.

* 1/4 tsp saffron threads
* Salt and pepper
* 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil
* 1 pound linguine
* Minced parsley for garnish

1. Combine the saffron with 1 Tbsp hot water in a small saucepan and let sit
   for 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it.

2. Add the olive oil to the saffron-water mixture and warm over very low heat.
   When the mixture begins to bubble, turn off the heat.

3. Cook the pasta until tender. Drain, then toss with the oil, salt and
   pepper. Garnish with parsley.
