A Greek dish similar to Ratatouille, but tastier, in my opinion.

* 3 T olive oil
* 1 large eggplant, thinly sliced
* 1 large onion, peeled & finely chopped
* 2 garlic cloves, peeled and diced
* 2 large potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
* 5 tomatoes, thinly sliced
* 6 zucchini, trimmed and thinly sliced
* Salt
* Freshly ground black pepper
* 1 t dried oregano
* 1.5c water
* 3 tsp breadcrumbs

Preheat oven to 400F. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a skillet over medium heat.
Add the eggplant, onion and garlic and saut√© for 5 to 7 minutes or until
softened. Place in a 12x12x2 baking dish. Place the potatoes, tomatoes and
zucchini in alternate layers on top of the eggplant and onion mixture, seasoning
each layer with salt, pepper and oregano. Pour the water and drizzle 1 t oil over
the top layer of zucchini. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs and drizzle with the
remaining tablespoon of oil. Bake for 45 minutes or until the top has browned and
the vegetables are tender.

Serve with some bread, olives and dry white wine.
