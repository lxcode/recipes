## Ingredients

* 8 ounces sea scallops
* 8 ounces rock shrimp
* 4 tablespoons scallions, coarsely chopped
* 3 tablespoons water chestnuts, coarsely chopped
* 4 tablespoons cilantro, coarsely chopped
* 3 tablespoons bamboo shoots
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon white pepper
* 1 small ice cube
* 1 tablespoon egg white
* 1 1/2 teaspoon oyster sauce
* 1/2 teaspoon fish sauce
* 1 teaspoon soy sauce
* 1 teaspoon sugar
* 1 tablespoon cornstarch
* 1 egg
* 1/2 teaspoon water
* 1 package won ton wrappers
* 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
* soy sauce (for dipping)

## Directions

Separate 3 oz. scallops and put aside in refrigerator. Chop remaining 5 oz.
very coarsely and place in a bowl. 

Add 3 oz. rock shrimp to scallops in refrigerator. Chop remaining shrimp very
coarsely and add to bowl of chopped scallops. 

Add green onions, water chestnuts, cilantro, and bamboo shoots to chopped
seafood (Make sure to squeeze excess liquid out of bamboo shoots). 

Place the reserved shrimp and scallops in the work bowl of a food processor. 
Add salt, pepper, egg white, and ice cube. Process until the ice is dissolved 
and the mixture is gummy. Add to the other ingredients. 

In a separate bowl, combine oyster sauce, fish sauce, soy sauce, sugar, and 
cornstarch. Whisk until smooth, then add to the other ingredients, mixing 
thoroughly. 

Separately mix the egg and water together. Place six wonton wrappers on a flat 
surface and brush lightly with water-egg mixture. Place a heaping teaspoon of 
filling on each wrapper and pinch the ends together, forming a half-moon 
shape. 

Continue filling additional wrappers until the filling is gone. 

Place dumplings in eight quarts rapidly boiling salted water and cook, 
stirring gently until they float and are firm to the touch. Remove with a 
slotted spoon or strainer and place on a lightly oiled plate and let cool. 

When ready to serve, heat a heavy bottom frying pan over medium heat and add 
oil. Add the pot stickers and cook until the bottoms are golden brown. 

Carefully pour 1/2 cup water (or ice cubes) in the pan and cover, steaming the 
pot stickers until the water disappears. 

Serve with soy sauce or soy with sesame oil and chili oil for dipping.
