# Pumpkin Stew

* 7-8 lb pumpkin (sugar pumpkin if possible)
* 2 Tb melted butter
* Salt & freshly ground pepper
* 4 cups beef broth
* Potatoes
* Celery
* Carrots
* Parsnips
* Garlic
* Turnips, rutabagas, whatever
* Stewing beef
* a couple Bay leaves

Cut a lid from pumpkin (leaving the stem on as a handle.) Clean it out.
Melt 2 tablespoons of the butter and brush it on the pumpkin interior.
Then, sprinkle with salt and pepper. Replace lid and place pumpkin in
a large pan or oven-to-table container. Bake in a preheated 400-degree
oven for 20 minutes.

Meanwhile, brown the beef, and start the vegetables and whatever spices
you like stewing. When the stew is about half done, put it in the
pumpkin. Cover, and bake for 45-60- minutes, or until the pumpkin is
tender, but not soft. Place on a serving dish. To serve, ladle out the
soup, scraping out a portion of pumpkin flesh with each serving.
