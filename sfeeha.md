# صفيحه باللحمه (Sfeeha)

To make about 16 pies

## Dough

* 2 1/4 to 2 3/4 cups lukewarm water (110' to 115')
* 2 packages active dry yeast
* A pinch of sugar
* 8 cups all-purpose flour
* 2 teaspoons salt
* 1/4 cup olive oil

Make the dough in the following fashion: Pour 1/4 cup of the lukewarm water into
a small, shallow bowl and sprinkle it with the yeast and sugar.  Let the mixture
rest for 2 or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely.  Set the
bowl in a warm, draft-free place (such as a turned-off oven) for about 5 minutes,
or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.  

In a deep mixing bowl, combine the flour and the 2 teaspoons of salt, make a well
in the center and into it pour the yeast mixture, the 1/4-cup of olive oil, and 2
cups of the remaining lukewarm water.  Gently stir the center ingredients
together with a large spoon, then slowly incorporate the flour and continue to
beat until the ingredients are well combined.  Add up to 1/2 cup more lukewarm
water, beating it in a tablespoon or so at a time, and using as much as necessary
to form a dough that can be gathered into a compact ball.  If the dough is
difficult to stir, work in the water with your fingers.  

Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and knead it by pressing it down,
pushing it forward several times with the heel of your hand and folding it back
on itself.  Repeat for about 20 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and
elastic.  Sprinkle it from time to time with a little flour to prevent it from
sticking to the board.  

Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl.  Drape loosely
with a kitchen towel and set aside in the warm, draft-free place for 45 minutes
to 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in bulk.  Punch the dough down with a
single blow of your fist and divide it into 16 equal pieces.  Roll each piece
into a ball about 1.5 inches in diameter, cover the balls with a towel and let
them rest for 30 minutes.


## FILLING

* 2 cups finely chopped onions
* 1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons salt
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 1/2-cup pine nuts (pignolia)
* 2 pounds lean boneless lamb, coarsely ground
* 2 medium-sized fresh, ripe tomatoes, peeled, seeded and finely chopped
* 1/2 cup finely chopped green pepper
* 1/2 cup finely chopped parsley, preferably flat-leaf parsley
* 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice
* 1/4 cup red wine vinegar
* 1-tablespoon tomato paste
* 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 teaspoon allspice
* Freshly ground black pepper

Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Drop the onions into a deep bowl and sprinkle
them with 1 tablespoon of the salt, turning them about with a spoon to coat them
evenly. Let the onions rest at room temperature for at least 30 minutes, then
squeeze them dry and return them to the bowl.

In a small skillet or saucepan, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil until a light haze
forms above it. Add the pine nuts and, stirring constantly, brown them lightly.
Add them to the bowl of onions, along with the lamb, tomatoes, green pepper,
parsley, lemon juice, vinegar, tomato paste, cayenne pepper, allspice, 2
teaspoons of salt and a liberal grinding of black pepper. Knead the mixture
vigorously with both hands, then beat with a wooden spoon until the mixture is
smooth and fluffy. Taste for seasoning.

Preheat the oven to 500F. With a pastry brush, coat 3 large baking sheets or
jellyroll pans with the remaining 3 tablespoons of oil.

On a lightly floured surface, roll each of the balls into a round about 4 inches
in diameter and no more than 1/8 inch thick.  To make open-faced pies, spoon
about cup of the lamb filling mixture on the center of each round. Then, with a
spatula or the back of the spoon, spread the filling to about inch of the edge.

To make closed pies, spoon about 1/2 cup of the filling on the center of each
round. Pull up the edge from 3 equally distant points to make a roughly
triangular-shaped pie and pinch the dough securely together at the top.

With a metal spatula, arrange the pies on the baking sheets. Bake in the
lower third of the oven for 30 minutes, or until the pastry is lightly
browned. Serve hot, or at room temperature, accompanied, if you like,
with yogurt.
