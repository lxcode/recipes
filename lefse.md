# Lefse

* 5 Lbs white potatoes
* 1/2 stick butter
* 2 cups flour
* a little milk

This is only good if you're Norwegian. I wouldn't advise it otherwise.

Cook potatoes. Peel when cool enough to handle, then chill well.  Grind with meat
grinder, (or put through sieve or ricer, or just mash thoroughly.

With your hands, add margarine, flour, and few drops milk. Chill thoroughly. 

Add a bit more flour so you can handle the dough. Working with about cup at a
time, on a floured surface, roll out to about 1/8 in thick. (Keep remaining dough
chilled.)

Fry on dry griddle until it has a few brown spots on the bottom. Flip (try using
a wooden spoon handle to turn it.). Cook other side.

Stack & keep wrapped in a moistened cotton cloth. Wrap this with plastic. Chill
in refrigerator for a few hours so it doesn't taste so floury.
