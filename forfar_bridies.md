# Forfar Bridies

## Pastry

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 6 oz. butter
* 2 eggs, lightly beaten

## Filling

* 1 lb. sirloin steak, cut into small pieces
* 2 medium onions, shredded
* 3 oz. shredded beef suet...mmmm...can probably use butter or lard instead.
* salt & pepper

To make the pastry, rub the butter into the flour by hand or by food processor
till the mixture resembles fine bread crumbs. Save one tablespoon of the beaten
eggs for glazing and stir the rest into the mixture until it binds together.
Divide into four balls and roll each on a floured board into an oval.

Put the meat, onions, suet, salt and pepper in a bowl and mix well.  Divide the
meat mixture in fourths and place on half of each oval, leaving a rim for
sealing. Wet edges, fold and seal. Crimp edges, pierce top with a fork, paint
with remaining beaten egg and place on a greased baking sheet. Bake at 350
degrees for 45 minutes until pastry is golden.

Some recipes call for a bit of Worcestershire sauce or dry mustard.

reasonably good.
