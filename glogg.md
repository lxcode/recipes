# Gløgg

A warm holiday punch from Norway. This is Gløgg, not Glögg. Glögg is for Swedes
and Finns or some such rabble.

* 24 cardamom seeds
* 2 cups blanched almonds
* 4 or more cinnamon sticks
* 12-24 cloves
* 12 Turkish white figs, or other variety (semi-dried)
* 3" or so fresh ginger, diced
* 2 cups golden raisins
* 2 oranges
* 2 large bottles (1.5L) cheap and crappy Burgundy
* 1 bottle (750ml) cheap Brandy (some may prefer Akevitt; you can also just add a cup or so of it in addition to the brandy.
* 2 bottles cheap ruby port (750ml)
* 1 bottle sweet vermouth (750ml)

Crush cardamom seeds in a quite big pot, then add cinnamon, cloves, figs, and
ginger, as well as peels from the two oranges. Add enough Burgundy to cover with
an inch to spare. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and cover. Let it sit
out for 3 days or so. Trust me, nothing will grow in this. Or if it does, it'll
die shortly, when...

On the day of the party, throw in the rest of the fruit, almonds and booze, and
juice the two peeled oranges into the pot. Bring to a boil, then simmer for a few
hours. If it's not sweet enough for your tastes, add a bit of orange or pineapple
juice. Drink carefully. Do not smoke while drinking, and take care when inhaling
the vapors.

Things to try:

Some lemon peel to brighten it a bit.
Honey as a sweetener. Preferably Icelandic.
