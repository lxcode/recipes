# Chicken with Sage, Bacon and Pears

* n chicken breasts
* n x 2 strips of bacon
* n x 4 leaves of sage
* n/2 pears, sliced into wedges
* dry vermouth

Wash the chicken breasts with vermouth. Put them in a baking dish, put about 4
leaves of sage on each breast, and then wind the two strips of bacon around it
so that the breast is mostly covered. Slice pears into wedges and distribute
among the chicken. Bake for 30 minutes at 375 degrees, then broil close to flame
for about 5 minutes to finish off the bacon.
